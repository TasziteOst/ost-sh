Ost SH is a social network generally focused on games, etc., but it is also valid for other types of categories.... as if it were Twitter, but Brazilian. 
# How Ost SH is made?
Ost SH was written on top of the Tidal Social Network, which is an Open Source project with the MIT License made by @uesleibros, but with changed Servers and API. 
# How Account Works?
If you have an account in the game Taszite: Madness, you can enter Ost SH with it (which is currently in development and has no preview of release). 
# Will there be updates? 
Updates will depend on Tidal, since I'm not used to programming... 
# What are the advantages? 
The advantages of this social network are that 

-Open Source Anyone can take this project and write on top, as long as they make their own assets, of course! 
-API Ost SH uses the Tidal API with SK Support 
-Bots Ost SH allows you to create bots too Before you download the project,

# Warning!
 keep this in mind! 

-You are not allowed to reuse the current assets of this project and the name and brand, seriously this is frustrating, writing on top of it is fine, but using it to pretend to be it is very frustrating because I don't want people to confuse it with the fake website
 -To modify the Project, you need Git and Node.JS installed and a program to add/edit code, that's why I recommend Visual Code Studio 

# What should I do after I download Node.JS and Git? 
When installing these programs 

> Open Node.JS 
 > In it, type "npm install" (removing the quotes)

 >Now go to your CMD 
  > type "cd desktop" 
    > then "git clone //link" 

Warning: Make sure to use the link to this directory or from Tidal, Tidal is the most recommended, since there may be some errors here

 I recommend you download Everything in ZIP instead of rewriting everything!
